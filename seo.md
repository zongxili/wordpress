# Search Engine Optimization

- process of optimizing website and webpages to get free organic traffic from Search engine like google


Google: 
- like a library
    - search through books & extract pages that contain your keywords or closely related word

    - all random 

     - tries to reture the most relevant results first by using **Sophisticated Algorighms**

    - "google ranking factors" 

        - let engine understand what page is abotu

        - worth ranking 



Steps:

- Find relevant keywords that people are searching for and see how these search queries ffit into my business

    - put myself into the shoes, see what potential customers would like to search

        - "**Aherf's keywords Explorer**"

            - Put name and riligions

        - see teh parent topic

        - look at the traffic and keywords
            - click on keywords, see all the keywords and ranking postiiton in the search engine


    - dont have to use exact matched keywords

    - dont do something "keyword stuffing and long story short"
        - does more harm than good
        - eg, "BC wedding photographer that does BC wedding photography for yoru BC wedding"



    Tips: 

    1st: Optimize title tags and meta descriptions
    - Title tag: the large title in blue
    - Meta Descriptions: the text below
    They entice people click on the page


    ## Once peopel click the page, then it tells Google the page is likely relevant to the Search Query


    In the **Meta Description**, explain in a couple brifft sentences what the page is about.

    Eg: "Zongxi was rated as the Star's best BC wedding photographer. He combiens creativity with science to capture life's happiest day in a million pixels"


    H1 or Heading tag: should include the text for searching

    **robots.txt** 
    - gives instructions to Search Engines on where they can and Can Not go on your site.
    - eg: Cart in my site, or RSS feeds

        - RSS feeds:  is a type of web feed which allows users and applications to access updates to websites in a standardized, computer-readable format.
